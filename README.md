# pyqt-openai
Example of using OpenAI with PyQt (Python cross-platform GUI toolkit)

This shows an example of using OpenAI with PyQt as a chatbot.

The OpenAI model this package uses is the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5">gpt-3.5-turbo</a> model(which is nearly as functional as <b>ChatGPT</b>) by default.

Image generation feature available since v0.0.16. You can see the detail in <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images/introduction">official OpenAI</a> site. Currently this feature is very basic now.

You can select other model with the combobox on the sidebar at the right side of the window.

An internet connection is required.

## Requirements
* PyQt5 >= 5.14
* aiohttp - It needs to be installed for the current version of OpenAI.
* openai

## Preview
This is using GPT-3.5 turbo model.

## How to play
1. git clone ~
2. from the root directory, type "cd pyqt_openai"
3. You should put your api key in the line edit. You can get it in <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys">official site</a> of openai. Sign up and log in before you get it. <b>By the way, this is free trial, not permanently free. See <a href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview">this</a> after you have logged in.</b>

Be sure, this is a very important API key that belongs to you only, so you should remember it and keep it secure.

4. python main.py

If installation doesn't work, check the troubleshooting below.

## Troubleshooting
If you see this error while installing the openai package
```
subprocess-exited-with-error
```
you can shout a curse word and just download the package itself from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/openai/#files">pypi</a>. 

Unzip it, access the package directory, type 
```
python setup.py install
```

That will install the openai.

## TODO list
* fine-tuning (with JSONL), Add the fine-tuned model in combo box <a href="https://github.com/yjg30737/pyqt-openai/tree/feature/fine-tuning">(branch)</a> - maybe i ditch this and use LlamaIndex instead because using fine-tuning costs a lot of money. 
* support PyQt6, PySide2, PySide6 <a href="https://github.com/yjg30737/pyqt-openai/tree/feature/qtpy">(branch)</a>
* show the explanation of every model and terms related to AI (e.g. temperature, topp..)
* show the left side bar to manage the past conversation <a href="https://github.com/yjg30737/pyqt-openai/tree/feature/leftsidebar">(branch)</a>
* highlight the source (eventually)
* add the basic example sources of making deep learning model with PyTorch (eventually)
